##CS241 Project Meetup
[demo](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~xzhu15/meetup/#/)

##Presented by: Xuefeng Zhu, Xue Zou
Work split-up: 

*	Xuefeng Zhu: UI design, Design database schema, Write most functional code, Brainstorm new ideas and functionality, Debug 
*	Xue Zou: UI design, data structure design, Facebook log-in, testing

##Overview
Our original intention is to make a todo list. Afterwards, we thought it would be great to socialize our todo list---it means that we can publish events from todo list and let other people join our events, such as shopping, hackathon and homework. The application is then named to “Meetup”, which means that it is a platform that brings people together so that they can meet and work with each other.

##Functionalities 
A website that helps you plan your schedule: 

*	To do lists
*	Details of each task
*	Date to finish

A platform where you collaborate with other people:

*	Event-sharing
*	Comment/Discuss
*	Instant private messages
*	Demonstrate work to teammates, like drawing and coediting
